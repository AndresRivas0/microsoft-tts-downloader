# Microsoft Text to Speech Downloader

Microsoft™ Text-to-Speech is a speech service that converts text into natural-sounding speech.
Our tool offers a easy way to use that service to synthesize audios.
With just one click, you can play or download the audio.
You do not need to be tech savvy or familiar with Microsoft Azure Cloud Service.

The tool charges a small fee to cover backend server costs of the PRO plan.
As far as I know, it‘s the most affordable tool you can find online.
